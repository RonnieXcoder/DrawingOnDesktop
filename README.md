# DrawingOnDesktop | Raylib

This application has the functionality to draw both on the desktop and over other windows. It utilizes a transparent window and texture rendering to create the effect of drawing over other applications and the desktop. Such an approach allows users to create notes, drawings, directly over the content of other applications.

This code uses the Raylib library for drawing.
